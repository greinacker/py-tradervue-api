# Python TraderVue API
This repository contains a Python implementation of the TraderVue API and small command line client. The client currently can only create new trades. More functionality will be added as needed/requested.

This API is documented [here](http://nall.github.io/py-tradervue/py-tradervue.html).

The TraderVue REST API is documented [here](https://github.com/tradervue/api-docs). 

## TODO
   * Convert times to datetime objects
   * Make returned dicts objects with attributes instead
