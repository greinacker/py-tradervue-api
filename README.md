# Python Tradervue API
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Tradervue API and small command line client. The client currently can only create new trades. More functionality will be added as needed/requested.

This API is documented [here](http://nall.github.io/py-tradervue/py-tradervue.html).

The Tradervue REST API is documented [here](https://github.com/tradervue/api-docs).
